Jumper is a game in which the player seeks to solve a puzzle by guessing the letters of a secret word one at a time.

Methodology:
Within the list of words the program, the function will choose a random word from this list of words, the system counts the number of times a user fails causing the input characters, word taking one at a time and comparing the letters with the chosen word.
For each failure 1 will be, increasing the number of failures. The user will win the game if the failure is 0 and 'You win' will be output. If the user typed the wrong letter then the program will ask the user to type another letter of the alphabet, all input characters will be stored in guesses. If the character does not match the word then “Wrong” will be output
